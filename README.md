# Day-planner

>This application allows the user to intereract with a simple and intuitive interface that shows a standard work day planner for the current day.
>
>We start with the top portion of the application witch uses the Moment.js library to format and display the current date.
>Next we have a time block for each hour between 9am and 5pm.  These time blocks are color coded:
>* Past hours (hours in the day that have already happened) are grey
>* The present hour is red
>* The future hours ( hours that haven't happened yet) are green
>
>The use can write into anytime block.  They can write whatever things they have scehduled for their day per hour, and save it by clicking the save button and that will save their inputs into the local storage.
>To clear out the time block, simply delete the text and then save the empty time block.
>Whatever the user saves will still be there when the user returns to the page.


This application takes advantage of jQuery and the Moment.js library.  Each line of code in my js file are code commented to explain every step to the fullest!
